# HW6-Weather-Dashboard-NLT

We were tasked to build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API. Users will be able to search the weather by city and get a 5 day forecast including the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

To access the deployed application go to: http://nicoletribo.github.io/HW6-Weather-Dashboard-NLT
